# Description
`arxiv_retriever` is a lightweight command-line tool designed to automate the retrieval of computer science papers from
[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/). The retrieval can be done using specified ArXiv computer science archive categories or 
using the full or partial title of a specific paper, if you have that.

This tool is built using Python and leverages the Typer library for the command-line interface and the Python ElementTree
XML package for parsing XML responses from the arXiv API. It can be useful for researchers, engineers, or students who
want to quickly retrieve an ArXiv paper or keep abreast of latest research in their field without leaving their
terminal/workstation.

Although my current focus while building `arxiv_retriever` has been on the computer science archive, it can be easily 
used with categories from other areas on arxiv.

# Features [more coming soon--see Notion page below for more info]
- Fetches the most recent papers from ArXiv by specified categories
- Fetches papers from ArXiv by title
- Displays paper details including title, authors, publication date, and link to paper's page
- Easy-to-use command-line interface built with Typer
- Configurable number of results to fetch
- Built using only the standard library and tried and tested packages.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/MimicTester1307/arxiv_retriever.git
   cd arxiv_retriever  
   ```
2. Install the package and dependencies
   ```shell
   pip install .
   ```

# Usage
To retrieve the most recent computer science papers by categories, use the `fetch` command followed by the categories and 
options:
   ```shell
   arxiv_retriever fetch <categories> [--limit]
   ```
*Outputs `limit` papers sorted by `submittedDate` in descending order*

To retrieve `limit` papers matching a specified title, use the `search` command followed by a title and options:
   ```shell
   arxiv_retriever search <title> [--limit]
   ```
*Outputs `limit` papers sorted by `relevance` in descending order*


## Example
Fetch the latest 5 papers in the cs.AI and cs.GL:
   ```shell
   arxiv_retriever fetch cs.AI cs.GL --limit 5
   ```

Fetch papers matching the title, "Attention is all you need":
   ```shell
   arxiv_retriever search "Attention is all you need" --limit 5
   ```
